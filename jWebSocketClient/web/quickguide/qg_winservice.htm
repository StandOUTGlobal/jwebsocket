<h2>jWebSocket Windows Service</h2>
<p>This section describes how to set up the jWebSocket server so that it runs as 
a windows service, e.g. on a Windows server. This topic will be interessting for 
you when you intend to run the jWebSocket Server on a dedicated production system.</p>
<p>It is quite simple to run the <code>jWebSocketSAServer.exe</code> as a stand-alone 
server by simply double-clicking it or putting a short-cut to it into the windows 
auto-start group. However, the drawback is that normal desktop applications are 
terminated when you log off the system. Unlike usual applications services remain 
running in the background even when you log off. Thus on a stand-alone server you 
need to remain logged in to run the jWebSocket Server which is not recommended due 
to security reasons.</p>
<p>To run the jWebSocket server w/o being logged in you either can run it as a Windows 
service by using the <tt>jWebSocketService.exe</tt> (described below) or alternatively 
embed it into a web application which is described
<a target="_self" href="qg_appserver.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing/uninstalling jWebSocketService</h3>
<p>To run the jWebSocket server as a Windows service please follow the following 
steps.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download the <tt>jWebSocketService.zip</tt> from the download area (you 
	also can click here).</li>
	<li>Unpack the <tt>.zip</tt> file into a local folder of your choice (e.g.

	<li>Change to that folder and run <tt>jWebSocketInstallService.bat</tt> to register 
	the <tt>jWebSocketService.exe</tt> as an Windows service.</li>
	<li>Check if the service has been properly installed in the Windows Service 
	Manager (select <tt>Start/Administrative Tools/Services</tt>).</li>
	<li>Right-click the <tt>jWebSocket Service</tt> entry and select <tt>Start</tt>.</li>
	<li>The service starts and the jWebSocket server is available.</li>
	<li>When you re-start the system the service will be started automatically.<br/><br/>

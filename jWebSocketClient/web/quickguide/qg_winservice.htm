<h2>jWebSocket Windows Service</h2>
<p>This section describes how to set up the jWebSocket Server so that it runs as 
a windows service, e.g. on a Windows server. This topic will be interessting for 
you when you intend to run the jWebSocket Server on a dedicated production system.</p>
<p>It is quite simple to run the <code>jWebSocketSAServer-&lt;version&gt;.exe</code> as a stand-alone 
server by simply double-clicking it or putting a short-cut to it into the windows 
auto-start group. However, a drawback is that normal desktop applications are 
terminated when you log off the system. Unlike usual applications services remain 
running in the background even when you log off. Thus on a stand-alone server you 
need to remain logged in to run the jWebSocket Server which, of course, is not recommended due 
to security reasons.</p>
<p>To run the jWebSocket server w/o being logged in you either can run it as a Windows 
service by using the <tt>jWebSocketService</tt><code>-&lt;version&gt;</code><tt>.exe</tt> (described below) or alternatively 
embed it into a web application which is described
<a target="_self" href="qg_appserver.htm">here</a>.</p>

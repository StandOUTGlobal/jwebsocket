<h2>Keep-Alive Mechanism</h2>
<p>Usually the jWebSocket Server terminates a session after a configurable 
amount of time of user inactivity. Because the server cannot register a hard 
shutdown of a client a timeout management for the session can hardly be avoided. 
This could be the case if the client process simply gets killed w/o giving the 
client a chance to send a <tt>close</tt> token to the server or if the connection 
gets lost e.g. due to network issues. If there was no timeout management the 
server would run out of ports and not accept further connections after a certain 
amount of time. </p>
<p>For streaming applications the user may not type anything for a longer time 
but just look what happens. For this case the client can send so called 
keep-alive pings to the server in certain configurable intervals. Then server 
then detects that the client is still alive and does not terminate the 
connection. Optionally the server can even send an acknowledge back to the 
client, so that also the client knows that the server is still working 
properly.</p>
<p>Both on the server and the client side the keep-alive functionality is 
implemented in the System plug-in.</p>
<h3>Keep-Alive Plug-In on the server</h3>
<p>For the server the jWebSocket project provides the 
<tt>org.jWebSocket.plugins.System</tt> class. It implements the 
<tt>ping</tt> token handling. For details please refer to the
<a href="dg_tokens.htm">Token Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Details pending...</p>
<h3>Keep-Alive Plug-In on the JavaScript client</h3>
<p>On the JavaScript client the System plug-in provides the two methods 
<tt>startKeepAlive</tt> and <tt>stopKeepAlive</tt>.</p>
<p>Details pending...</p>
